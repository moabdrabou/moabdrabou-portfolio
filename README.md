## üèÉ Getting Started

To explore the codebase and make any changes, follow these simple steps.

### Installation

This project is primarily a static web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to be deployed directly. Therefore, there are no specific installation steps for dependencies to "run" it locally in a development server. You can simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the site, though for development, using a live server extension in your IDE (like Live Server for VS Code) is recommended.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/moabdrabou/moabdrabou-portfolio.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd moabdrabou-portfolio
    ```

From here, you can open the project in your favorite code editor to review the files, modify the code, or contribute.
